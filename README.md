I'm currently enhancing my English skills while diving into the exciting world of web development. This is my first project built with HTML, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge through The Odin Project, focusing on frontend development.

I have a strong passion for design, and I believe this makes me a great candidate to become a successful frontend developer. I'm excited to start a new career in software development, where I can combine my love for design with my technical skills.

My goal is to master HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and then delve into a framework like Vue or Angular. I'm particularly drawn to the dynamic capabilities of these frameworks and how they can enhance user experience.

I'm confident that with dedication and continuous learning, I can achieve my goal of becoming a proficient frontend developer.
